Fit the Dice is a small, very small puzzle game created for the 2022 GMTK Game Jam. In the 48h window i came up with this simple mechanic and made it into a game. In the game you controll a dice which you need to place on the target field with the right number up. To achive this you can only rotate your dice in 4 directions in the confinement of the playing field.

There are 5 little puzzles which u can solve. Sadly due to time limits i couldn't make more complex puzzle mechanics and I think that those 5 Levels already use the whole complexity. 

All in all I'm pretty pleased with this one. This is my third game and i can feel the speed of the development process ramping up which is very exciting. I could use my Mesh creation knowledge I learned during my last project which i sadly wasn't able to finish in time.

Things to add in the future, maybe.

- More Puzzle mechanics eg. moving platforms or doors or maybe a even something that mirrors the dice who knows-

- A level Selections Screen and a level Selections Screen. just some more UI

- Change up the appearance of the whole game eg. making the platform 3 Dimensional and adding some textures and decorations.
