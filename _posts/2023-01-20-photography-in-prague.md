## Our Trip to Prague
Its the 2nd of April 2022. My school class and I enter the Bus to Prague. Its the end for us, the windup of 4 years of school. In front of us a week of fun and the end of the schoolyear. Behind us the the many hours of school. Hyped for the week, but a bit melancholic nevertheless, we took our seats.

Of course i imediatly started taking photos. As there was nothing but streets outside our car I had to try and capture those streets from their best side. And I'm quite happy how they turned out.

This trip is tradition in our Gymnasiums, the swiss pre schools for university. As the class we could decide on our own where we would go and what we will do. Prague was the most popular idea in the planning stage. Other ideas were Amsterdam or "somewhere in italy".

When we arrived in Prague we took the streetcar to get to our hotel. If you ever go to prague be carful not to walk infront of such a streetcar. They are pretty fast and probably wont be able to stop in time. Nevertheless they made a fantastic subject to capture on my camera.
